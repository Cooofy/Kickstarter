# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
By using past data and information that was gathered on past Kickstarter we are pinpoint at first that is based on a campaign launch date how many were successful, failed or even cancelled. We then narrowed the data even further by only looking at the Theater categories to see all their past outcomes base on just launch date. Next, we wanted to see the outcomes of past Kickstarters just solely on the set goal amount we set for each campaign.

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to see if we can find a balance of having the right amount of funds needed for a campaign and when itâ€™s a good time to start it. With the raw data we can generate graphs and tables for all categories or if we wanted to only look at a certain sub category.

## Analysis and Challenges

##### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By using a pivot table, we are able to narrow down the dataset to see how certain categories are successful based on their launch date. By narrowing it down to just Theater categories we can created a line chart to visually show how which month(s) you should launch and when not to launch your Kickstarter. 
##### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
By categorizing the goal amounts we are able to see the percentages of successful and failed projects based on just required goals. By converting that data to a line graph we are able to see trends and possible patterns to help us make a more informed decision.

##### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A possible challenge is that when comparing the two types of datasets we are assuming that there is no correlation on the success rate. We are just using one dataset such as launch date or funding goal to determine success. As if we combined the two datasets, we can possibly get a better answer on when to launch a theater Kickstarter. 
## Results
1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- Based on the line graph we can clearly see that to have your theater Kickstarter to be successful is to launch it in May. However, we do not know the clear reasoning on why there is a high success rate in the month of May for theater Kickstarters. As it could be just luck where that Kickstarters that launched in May were successful or that someone saw a trend and decided to start their theater Kickstart in May. To avoid having your theater Kickstarter failing you should avoid launching it in the fourth quarter. Also, with line graph we can clearly see that no projects were cancelled in the month of October, they were either successful or failed. ![Theater Oucomes Based on Launch Date](https://github.com/Cooofy/Kickstarter/blob/1318e2e2f96f70d7e7137c9ade88577ab21419c7/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- By looking at the line graph (Outcomes Based on Goals) we can see a trend where that with the goal required for the Kickstarter the likelihood of it being successful gets lower. However, we can see an outlier with the data as goals between $35,000.00 to $45,000.00 have a solid success rate. ![Outcomes Based On Goals](https://github.com/Cooofy/Kickstarter/blob/1318e2e2f96f70d7e7137c9ade88577ab21419c7/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
- One of the limitations would how the data was collected therefore we cannot account for its accurately as well its presents of biases during the survey process such as if we got the dataset online via a website, we do not know how they collected the data. We would to know how the original dataset was collected, how rigorous was process of the collecting the data. Another limitation is the features of the dataset, as if we included demographics (age, culture, etc.) which could change the outcomes of Kickstarters. 

4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- One of the possible graphs and tables we can create to give us a better conclusion on the dataset is comparing the backers count and average donation. This could show us that if it a viable plan to have target a small number of wealthy backers to meet the funding goal or to have a mixture of donation size.
